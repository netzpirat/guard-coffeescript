# Guard::CoffeeScript [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/netzpirat/guard-coffeescript.png)](http://travis-ci.org/netzpirat/guard-coffeescript)

Guard::CoffeeScript compiles or validates your CoffeeScripts automatically when files are modified.
If you're looking for a CoffeeScript merge tool, please checkout [Guard::CoffeeDripper](https://github.com/guard/guard-coffeedripper).

Tested on MRI Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, REE and the latest versions of JRuby & Rubinius.

If you have any questions please join us on our [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/guard-dev) or on `#guard`
(irc.freenode.net).

## Install

The simplest way to install Guard is to use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
Please make sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed.

Add Guard::Coffeescript to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'guard-coffeescript'
end
```
Add the default Guard::Coffeescript template to your `Guardfile` by running:

```bash
$ guard init coffeescript
```

## JSON

The JSON library is also required but is not explicitly stated as a gem dependency. If you're on Ruby 1.8 you'll need
to install the `json` or `json_pure` gem. On Ruby 1.9, JSON is included in the standard library.

## CoffeeScript

Guard::CoffeeScript uses [Ruby CoffeeScript](https://github.com/josh/ruby-coffee-script/) or
[Ruby CoffeeScript Redux](https://github.com/samwgoldman/ruby-coffee-script-redux) to compile the CoffeeScripts,
that in turn uses [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) to pick the best runtime to evaluate the JavaScript.

* With CRuby you want to use a V8 JavaScript Engine or Mozilla SpiderMonkey.
* With JRuby you want to use the Mozilla Rhino.
* On Mac OS X you want to use Apple JavaScriptCore.
* On Linux or as a node.js developer you want to use Node.js (V8).
* On Windows you want to use Microsoft Windows Script Host.

If you are using CoffeeScript Redux, you can enable the source map generation by setting the `:source_map` option to
`true`.

## JavaScript runtimes

The following sections gives you a short overview of the available JavaScript runtimes and how to install it.

### Node.js (V8)

You can install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and use its V8 engine. On OS X you may want to install it with
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), on Linux with your package manager and on Windows you have to download and
install the [executable](http://www.nodejs.org/#download).

### V8 JavaScript Engine

To use the [V8 JavaScript Engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8/), simple add `therubyracer` to your `Gemfile`.
The Ruby Racer acts as a bridge between Ruby and the V8 engine, that will be automatically installed by the Ruby Racer.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'therubyracer'
end
```

Another alternative is [Mustang](https://github.com/nu7hatch/mustang), a Ruby proxy library for the awesome Google V8
JavaScript engine. Just add `mustang` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'mustang'
end
```

### Mozilla SpiderMonkey

To use [Mozilla SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey), simple add `johnson` to your `Gemfile`.
Johnson embeds the Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript runtime as a C extension.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'johnson'
end
```

### Mozilla Rhino

If you're using JRuby, you can embed the [Mozilla Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) runtime by adding `therubyrhino`
to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'therubyrhino'
end
```

### Apple JavaScriptCore

[JavaScriptCore](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/WebKit_JavaScriptCore_Ref/index.html)
is Safari's Nitro JavaScript Engine and only usable on Mac OS X. You don't have to install anything, because
JavaScriptCore is already packaged with Mac OS X.

### Microsoft Windows Script Host

[Microsoft Windows Script Host](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9bbdkx3k.aspx) is available on any Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::CoffeeScript can be adapted to all kind of projects. Please read the
[Guard documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

### Ruby project

In a Ruby project you want to configure your input and output directories.

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'coffeescripts', :output => 'javascripts'
```

If your output directory is the same as the input directory, you can simply skip it:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'javascripts'
```

### Rails app with the asset pipeline

With the introduction of the [asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) in Rails 3.1 there is
no need to compile your CoffeeScripts with this Guard.

However, if you would still like to have feedback on the validation of your CoffeeScripts
(preferably with a Growl notification) directly after you save a change, then you can still
use this Guard and simply skip generation of the output file:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/assets/javascripts', :noop => true
```

This give you a faster compilation feedback compared to making a subsequent request to your Rails application. If you
just want to be notified when an error occurs you can hide the success compilation message:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/assets/javascripts', :noop => true, :hide_success => true
```

### Rails app without the asset pipeline

Without the asset pipeline you just define an input and output directory like within a normal Ruby project:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts'
```

## Options

There following options can be passed to Guard::CoffeeScript:

```ruby
:input => 'coffeescripts'           # Relative path to the input directory.
                                    # A suffix /(.+\.coffee) will be added to this option.
                                    # default: nil

:output => 'javascripts'            # Relative path to the output directory.
                                    # default: the path given with the :input option

:noop => true                       # No operation: do not write an output file.
                                    # default: false

:bare => true                       # Compile without the top-level function wrapper.
                                    # Provide either a boolean value or an Array of filenames.
                                    # default: false

:shallow => true                    # Do not create nested output directories.
                                    # default: false

:source_map => true                 # Do create the source map file.
                                    # default: false

:hide_success => true               # Disable successful compilation messages.
                                    # default: false

:all_on_start => true               # Regenerate all files on startup
                                    # default: false

:error_to_js => true                # Print the Coffeescript error message directly in the
                                    # JavaScript file
                                    # default: false
```

### Output short notation

In addition to the standard configuration, this Guard has a short notation for configure projects with a single input
and output directory. This notation creates a watcher from the `:input` parameter that matches all CoffeeScript files
under the given directory and you don't have to specify a watch regular expression.

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'javascripts'
```

### Selective bare option

The `:bare` option can take a boolean value that indicates if all scripts should be compiled without the top-level
function wrapper.

```ruby
:bare => true
```

But you can also pass an Array of filenames that should be compiled without the top-level function wrapper. The path of
the file to compile is ignored, so the list of filenames should not contain any path information:

```ruby
:bare => %w{ a.coffee b.coffee }
```

In the above example, all `a.coffee` and `b.coffee` files will be compiled with option `:bare => true` and all other
files with option `:bare => false`.

### Nested directories

The Guard detects by default nested directories and creates these within the output directory. The detection is based on
the match of the watch regular expression:

A file

```ruby
/app/coffeescripts/ui/buttons/toggle_button.coffee
```

that has been detected by the watch

```ruby
watch(%r{^app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)$})
```

with an output directory of

```ruby
:output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'
```

will be compiled to

```ruby
public/javascripts/compiled/ui/buttons/toggle_button.js
```

Note the parenthesis around the `.+\.coffee`. This enables Guard::CoffeeScript to place the full path that was matched
inside the parenthesis into the proper output directory.

This behavior can be switched off by passing the option `:shallow => true` to the Guard, so that all JavaScripts will be
compiled directly to the output directory.

### Multiple source directories

The Guard short notation

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'
```

will be internally converted into the standard notation by adding `/(.+\.coffee)` to the `input` option string and
create a Watcher that is equivalent to:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
  watch(%r{^app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)$})
end
```

To add a second source directory that will be compiled to the same output directory, just add another watcher:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
  watch(%r{lib/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
end
```

which is equivalent to:

```ruby
guard 'coffeescript', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
  watch(%r{app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
  watch(%r{lib/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
end
```
